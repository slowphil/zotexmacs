Have Zotero interact with TeXmacs

Zotexmacs is a very simple tool that eases referencing articles in [TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org) when your bibilographic database is handled by [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

With Zotexmacs you no longer have to know, guess, or look up what is the citation key of that article you want to cite. From within a Zotero window, Zotexmacs directly inserts the appropriate cite tag for the selected items into the currently active TeXmacs document.

#Requirements
You need both [Texmacs](http://www.texmacs.org) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) already installed.

#Short doc 
Install the signed xpi file in Firefox (or Zotero standalone) and add the content of the file "place in my-init-texmacs.scm" where indicated.

#More doc 
Open "zotexmacs doc.tm" in TeXmacs.
